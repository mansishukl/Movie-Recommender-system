Overview: Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬
The Movie Recommender System is a dynamic project designed to help users discover movies they might enjoy based on their preferences. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, the system analyzes movie attributes and relationships to generate tailored recommendations. The project moves beyond simple data analysis to deliver an interactive experience through a web application built with the Streamlit framework.

 Project Overview

 Features:
1. Kaggle Dataset: The movie recommendation system uses datasets from Kaggle related to movies and user ratings.
2. Jupyter Notebook: Initial data analysis and recommendation model development were performed in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Streamlit Framework: The system is converted into a web application using Streamlit, enabling an interactive user experience.
4. Pickle Library: Used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures to save the recommendation model for reuse.
5. User Input: Users can input a movie name, and the system will suggest 4-5 related movies.

 How It Works

 1. Data Processing
- Two datasets from Kaggle are imported and processed in Jupyter Notebook.
- Cleaning, merging, and exploratory data analysis are performed to prepare the data for recommendations.

 2. Recommendation System
- A recommendation algorithm is built using the processed data to suggest related movies.
- The model is serialized using the Pickle library for seamless integration into the web app.

 3. Web Application
- The Python script is transformed into an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.
- The app allows users to input a movie name and receive recommendations in real-time.

 Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language for data analysis and app development.
- Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and building the recommendation model.
- Streamlit: To create a web application from the Python script.
- Pickle: For model serialization.
- PyCharm: IDE used for Python development.

---

 Usage

1. Input a movie name in the app.
2. The system will suggest 4-5 related movies based on the dataset and recommendation model.
3. Explore the recommendations interactively through the Streamlit interface.

 Dataset

- The datasets used in this project are sourced from Kaggle. They contain movie details and user ratings essential for building the recommendation system.

 Future Enhancements

- Adding more datasets to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Incorporating advanced recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering or deep learning.
- Enhancing the web application's UI for a better user experience.
